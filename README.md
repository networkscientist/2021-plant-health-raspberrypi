# KiraPi
The KiraPi system was created as part of the _Seminar Geodata Analysis_. It monitors soil moisture, air temperature as well as the relative humidity of the air. Furthermore, the collected data is represented in graphs.
The project is built on top of a Raspberry Pi system and coded in Python3.
